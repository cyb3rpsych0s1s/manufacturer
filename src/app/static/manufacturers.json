The corporation was run as a partnership until 2019, when Leidsplein dropped out of sight on a trip to the U.K. At that time, von Manhoffen-Mass restructured the management and brought Dr. Christopher Mitchell on as chief of R&D."

The potential of CHOOHZTM was realized almost immediately after it was introduced, and within a few years all fuel burning vehicles and power plants had converted to the new fuel. Although Biotechnica held worldwide patents, it lacked the production facilities to meet worldwide demand, forcing it to license production to several large agribusinesses and petro-corporations. These deals made Biotechnica an extremely wealthy, but still not particularly large, company. It is currently expanding and working on its next big biotechnical breakthrough."

There again the same problem slowed the acceptance of the eurodollar in the EC after it was founded. The world is getting smaller all the time, people regularly work in many countries these days and this is making salary paytments very tricky, an employee paid in US dollars may find things a little too expensive while working in Tokyo for example. As time goes on corporations, and even governments, will find that the only way to convince their employees they have a stable salary is to pay them in euro. Within the next twenty to thirty years national currencies should just fade out from use and be replaced by the euro, which will probably be renamed the worlddollar, terrabuck, or something equally neutral sometime soon.The Eurobank reserves are stored in the mountains between Freilassing and Salzburg in the strongest vaults on the planet. The entrance is precisely on the old border between Germany and Austria. The reserves hold not only the traditional rare metals and metals, but also valuable patents, property deeds, and other items.

    "background": "After its technological coup in 1998 with the Hermes II spaceplane, the European Space Agency looked fit to control most of the rapidly expanding sphere of colonized space. In the same year ESA began the recruitment of milions of people from the central African nations. In an event now known as the ESA Hireout, entire African townships were brought into orbit, trained and put to work. ESA took control of LEO for manufacturing and colonization, developing the more advanced Aries series space planes and constructing hundreds of workshacks and the magnificent Crystal Palace habitat (a glittering toroidal playground for the rich).Since its founding, ESA has focused on orbital manufacturing and has obtained funding from several Euromultinationals who have traded both raw material and eurobucks for a slice of the orbital manufacturing industry. ESA also implemented a historic deal with the Soviets, who provided heavy lift capacity in return for spaceplane payloads. Orbital Air (the main carrier of personnel into space) was instgated by ESA and is stil the only licensed owner of the Aries series spaceplanes.By 2015, ESA was the largest, richest and most capable spacefaring organization in existence. It creamied a 10% commission off all space-related manufacturing, and controlled most of the law enforcement in LEO and out to Luna through the EEC-controlled Interpol space police. They proceeded, to build several major orbital habitats, including three O'Neill colonies (huge rotating cylinders of lunar rock and metal framing several kilometers in diameter).Unfortunately, as ESA grew and expanded, it became more bureaucratic and authoritarian. The main orbital population (approximately 68%) stemmed from the Hireout and was growing exponentially. These individuals, many born and bred in space, were hardy and individualistic and saw the orbital colonies as \"home\". This population, known as the \"hightiders\", eventually revolted against the growing pressure from ESA to overcrowd the orbital colonies and force many workers to operate in sub-standard conditions for litle reward. This blewup into a series of short but violent clashes between Hightiders and ESA known as the O'Neill Wars, during which ESA lost control of both O'Neill One and the newer Galileo Cylinder.By 2025 ESA still controls the majority of facilites in LEO. It maintains both Crystal Palace and Paradise Station (an O'Neill cylinder at the L-4 point). ESA also has access to long range drive technology and with Soviet help has set up a Mars Base at Isic Planitia. All ESA facilities are now kept under oppressive surveillance by Interpol and elite ESA corporate squads to ensure that the O'Neill Wars do not have any successors."

It was originally a watch manufacturer in Kamisuwa, which expanded in the 1980's. It got its biggest boost by launching an orbital factory with the aid of JAB and Kenjin Technology. Soon, Kiroshi practically monopolized the optics business due to the quality of its orbital eyes and other products such as the opti-shield, the optical HUD (heads up display), the optical remote cyber-cam, and the anti-dazzle protection \"Opti-Flash\".Kiroshi has very close ties with Kenjiri, and they have a joint design firm in orbit, to be closer to the manufacturing process.Now, Kiroshi is aiming to dominate the Asian market. Hong Kong and Shanghai, where cheap Kiroshi imitations are made, are the company's prime targets."

His attempts at genetically engineering sea plant and animal life resulted in the creation of new foods and other organic products for consumption. Their greatest creation is the floating synthetic plastic known as Crypropalan. Made from the remains of genetically engineered microfauna, it is what many of the floating cities rest on. Strong, incredibly bouyant, light and derived from a renewable natural source, it was a breakthrough in construction science.In 1996 Russell's scientists perfected their tidal energy converters and thermal varience converters and began beaming energy to the power-hungry masses in major cities of the world. Damon Russell was killed in an extraction attempt in 2006 by OTEC's largest rival, Unified Ocean Sciences, a hostile takeover attempt by Sean Lowell, head of UOS. Amanda Russell, Damon's wife has run the company since his death and has expanded OTEC's earnings by thirty percent in seven years.Since then OTEC has been the undisputed leader in ocean technological advances and continues to rule the seas. They have been under media assault in recent years because of the fact that they have attempted to nationalize their floating islands and stations. This would give them more claim to the surrounding resources than they already have.The corporation has, however, been a large source of food, plastics, petroleum products, liquid hydrogen production, stress science technology (which gets used in space exploration as well as underwater colonization), genetic engineering, and motion energy sciences. Space exploration and colonization is their next field of endeavor and they are currently seeking an energy source with greater energy return per pound than fusion."

In 1970, George Peak and Salvatore Derrera were a couple of grunts stuck in the middle of the Cambodia invasion. During quiet periods, the pair would talk about what they would do if they made it back to the world. There was nothing else to do but talk, and it was better than listening to the crickets chirp. Both men had heard the news : the situation at home was starting to sour. They shared the same philosophy that the smart investor would tum to technology as America's industrial base weakened.Peak and Derrera both survived the war and kept in contact with each other when they returned to the US. In early 1972, \"Sally\" Derrera called Peak with a business offer : if both men could scrape up $25,000 to start with, it was possible for them to break into the precious industrial diamond market. Peak was skeptical but after some research decided to invest. Thus in January 1973 an idea that began as a way to soothe the combat jitters flourished into a financial reality. The partnership of Peak & Derrera was born.The company expanded into Asia at first, treading delicately into the new Chinese and Japanese markets that were opening up. When the computer age began in 1979, the company cornered a nice chunk of the silicon market. With customers like Atari and IBM, the firm's fortune was assured. Peak & Derrera was incorporated in 1980. With the boom of the 1980s, the company grew quickly, breaking into various industrial and precious metal markets. When the party ended in '94, most of the Asian developments were sold off for vital cash. Later, that cash was used to invest in the critical European market.In 2002, George Peak sold his interests in the company and became an independent investor. The Wasting Plague incapacitated Sal Derrera in 2003, and he sold his share to Penstone Equities. Orvis became chairman of the board, but the firm's original name was retained for its prestige."

With the best heavy lifting vehicles and the largest body of data on long-term, man-in-space projects, the Soviets were able to trade themselves into the current space frontier boom. They sold advertising on spacesuits, set up construction projects, and eventually established Kosmosov, the heavy lifting vehicle combine.Trading for ESA technical information, the SRC also built up a moderate military presence with orbital stations, spy and laser sats, battle sats and ground laser arrays. The huge laser complex at Sary Shagan has since been entirely converted to laser-lift vehicle support, but can be reconverted within 72 hours.Still working closely with ESA, the Soviets maintain a strong and active presence in space. They are clear leaders in terms of raw lift power out of the Earth well and have been enormously successful in construction of long-term life-support systems. The Soviets are also the recognized experts in space psychology. There is a minimal Soviet presence within the Chryse base on Mars; however, rumours abound that the Soviets are planning their own unmanned missions to Mercury and Venus to set up mining facilities."

She is the only female business leader in Korea, and is under considerable criticism from many segments of society for not letting a man run the show. She also draws a lot of respect from the other half of the society, for the same reasons.Sungan's business techniques are quite radical, and the advertisements are often shocking, and critical of Korean society. The conservatives blame her for corrupting the masses. This particularly endears this company's products to the growing Cyberpunk movement in Korea (students, women, former expatriates) who are their main customers."

    "background": "Tanson is the strongest of the \"typical\" Korean Zaibatsus. Chon Chung II, the leader of Tanson, still dominates the zaibatsu despite his advanced age of 95. He has strong connections with both the Korean military and political worlds. Many of the Neo-Yangban followers of Korea are thought to be allied with Tanson Group. They are expanding their business activities to every industrial area and are becoming incredibly diverse, like IEC or CITIC. This is unusual for a Korean corporation, which usually specializes in limited areas. Tanson's hostile takeovers and belligerency towards \"Noje companies\" are a cause of great worry in Korean economic circles.Chon Chung II is convinced that Korea is being corrupted by foreign influences, and the prime accomplice is Sungan Industries. He is building up to the day when he can declare an economic jihad on Sungan and Sun UnSuk. He also fanatically hates Arasaka Saburo. The mere mention of the name is enough to provoke a room-smashing fury from the Korean business leader. Rumor has it that the Chon family were former servants on the Arasaka estates in Korea during the occupation. Neither side will confirm or deny."

Rumors abound of a rogue AI (stolen from either the Pentagon or Arasaka), but Tsunami flatly denies such claims and there has been absolutely no proof brought to light on this topic. For many years, Tsunami was a top secret organization, working strictly behind the scenes, providing designs to governments and a few select corporations, but in the last three years they have expanded their services into the public market. Response has been excellent, and Tsunami's economic growth has been almost frightening."

Within five years they had perfected molecular scale techniques and began floating initial prototypes onto the market, mostly small scale healing drugs, skinweave, etc.Once the base technology was perfected it brought an asymptotic rise in the development of further enhanced products. By 2025 all major corporations are investing in the development of nanotech construction, drugs, computers and in fact anything else. With this astonishing rise in new technology has begun the rise of UC, now the largest orbital manufacturer and corporate shining star. UC's technological capability currently far outstrips any other corporation and some frightening rumours abound about their latest innovations.UC has begun building facilities throughout the solar system. Corporate insiders suggest that the recent destruction of USAF's flagship Andromeda, billed as the most powerful gunship in existence, may have been instigated by UC. Suggestions that UC has begun construction of its own deep space-capable craft have been met with ridicule by UC executives."

WNS has at least a small office in almost every major city in the world, but these are sometimes no more than rooms with a few provisions, one resident agent and a Telecom-Terminal linked to the nearest regional office. Few competitors can match WNS' information gathering capabilities, and WNS ensures that it remains at the forefront, not only through legitimate means, but also through spying, espionage, sabotage and illegal snooping of all sorts. WNS does not run any stations of its own, choosing instead to broker its information to the highest bidder. There is no shortage of buyers, as ratings-hungry broadcasters will fork over millions for exclusive rights to an especially juicy story and the included multi-media presentation package containing WNS' videos, write-ups and commentaries."
